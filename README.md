# kidsControl

small python server to check what the kids are doing in their computer.
the server will be module based, for now I want it to have : lock the computer and take screenshots
I'm doing this project to practice some python, so every fork, pull request or comment is helpful :-)

#RUN

windows :
just run the server.exe from the dist folder

linux:
python server.py

#DEVELOPMENT

1. clone :
`git clone https://github.com/EranGoldman/kidsControl.git`
2. update code or modules.
3. send push request.

#TODO

1. computer lock module
2. cron system to schedule tasks
3. make the executable invisible in windows
